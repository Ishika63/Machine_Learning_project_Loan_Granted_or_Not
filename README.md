# Machine_Learnirng_project_Loan_Granted_or_Not
In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc. The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed. 

**The major aim of this notebook is to predict which of the customers will have their loan approved.**
